# Robotic-Hand-Ethohand-II-
For my Robotics Masters project I designed, developed, and ran an experiment with a robotic hand called the Ethohand II. I designed the robotic hand on SOLIDWORKS based on the orginal Ethohand. The parts were 3D printed and assembled. 32 servo motors to control the flexion and extension of each joint. The CyberGlove was used to teleoperate the robot hand. The Cyberglove output data every fraction of a second corresponding to the strain gauges within the glove for each joint. These values were mapped to the angle ranges of each servo motor in Matlab and these values were sent to the Arduino to move the servos. The robotic hand was tested by manipulating various objects and imitating the poses set in the Grasp Taxonomy. A pick and place experiment was performed using the Ethohand II.

The code was not my property so is not shown in this repository.
